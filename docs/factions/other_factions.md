# Unallied Factions

Outside of the ruling cities and those who have sworn allegiance to them, There are factions vying for power in the Sea Ringed World that are unallied or even opposed to those in power. Either for their own personal gain or for other, more principled reasons, these factions answer only to themselves.

## The Nons

Once powerful warlords that roamed the land and terrorized weaker villages, their decline came swiftly once the original ruling cities formed an alliance and brought the smaller villages under their protections. The once proud warrior faction became a group of raiders and slavers, and the ruling cities agreed never to allow the Nons into their alliance. Citizens of the empire do not deal with the Nons for fear of retribution from the emperor, so the Nons must subsist on pillaging and thievery.
