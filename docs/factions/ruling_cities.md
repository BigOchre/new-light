# The Ruling Cities

The Sea Ringed World is filled with various factions, tribes, and cities. Three city-states act as ruling parties, eschewing outright warfare in favor of politics and social control: Sochitlan, The City of Flowers; Tyr, the City of Light; Athon, the City of Rust. All other cities, factions, and tribes pay tribute to these 3 cities states, who divide the tribute according to their respective power and standing.

## Sochitlan

Sochitlan, The City of Flowers, is the largest and most powerful city-state. It enjoys dominion of the entire central valley of the world, including the great lake that extends from the western mountain range to the south and almost all the way to the east. The capitol itself rests in the center of this vast lake. The Emperor's Palace, an obelisk made of an unbelievable dense and dark material, serves as an anchor to all of the other structures that float on the water, connected to the emperor's obelisk and each other with cords of rope. Sochitlan is a place of commerce. Merchants sell their wares on boats, travelling within the lake and up the rivers that connect Sochitlan to the rest of the world. All rivers -- or at least, all the ones that matter-- lead to Sochitlan. Sochitlan receives the lion's share of tribute.

## Tyr

Tyr, the City of Light, resides in the northeastern mountain range, extending south and west to meet Sochitlan, and east to reach the end of the world. Tyr is where the Temple of Light resides, and as such is the astronomical and spiritual leader of the world. The Light Eaters, keepers of the Temple of Light, read the night sky for portents, and leaders of factions across the world come for guidance. Though the mountains make attacking Tyr difficult, the city-state doesn't boast a strong military force. Their main protection against invaders is their favor with the Mute God, and this seems to be in question because of recent events. Tyr receives only slightly more tribute than Athon.

## Athon

Athon, the City of Rust, lays claim to the northwestern deserts and, so it says, much of the western mountain ranges -- though these ranges are always in contention among the inhabitants. After having defeated the previous ruling city, Athon is known as the military center of the land, and as such enjoys the smallest portion of tribute. The deserts where Athon's capitol lies are flecked bountifully with flecks of rusted iron and less so with flecks of gold and other precious materials, giving the ground a red hue and a telltale glint at dawn and dusk. Landmarks and ruins of ancient civilizations are hidden and revealed as the sands shift, making navigation through Athon difficult and dangerous. Though Sochitlan and Tyr are the more prestigious cities, Athon is the oldest, and most ambitious, of the three.
