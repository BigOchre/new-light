# The Tributaries

The three ruling city-states receive tribute from countless subordinate factions. Some are closely allied with one major city or another, while others maintain neutrality. While there are many factions, There are 6 Tributaries of note: five (5) within the aegis of the ruling cities, and a sixth that tenaciously avoids subjugation.

While the ruling city-states provide order and a degree of protection, and often share their wealth, Their rule is absolute. Tributaries have no sway once a city's passed judgement, and resentment grows among the more powerful tributaries.

While the ruling cities avoid outright war, the smaller cities are shaped by it. A faction might engage in skirmishes or large scale assaults with its neighbor, only to return to trading and venturing into each other's territories within months of ending the conflict.

While there are many tributaries, only 6 are noteworthy enough to merit a seat at the council:
Iwitlan, The City of Feathers; House Kratyss, of the Smoking Stone; House Deseia, of the Weeping Tower; House Haolus, the Screaming Ones, Elyss, Land of Burning Water; Shabara, Land of Broken Sky.

## Iwitlan

Iwitlan, the City of Feathers, is a roaming city whose influence extends throughout the jungle it travels through. All settlements build their cities atop and hanging from the enormous glass beasts that wander through the jungle, but Iwitlan is built on the largest and most dangerous: A giant glass moth known as Ghost Eye. Iwitlan is a rich and well defended city, once favored as one of the ruling class. They have access to plentiful biological numenera and other riches, and all of the cities move undetected through the jungle, making an attack difficult. They were defeated by the City of Rust only through trickery, and it is only because of their sense of honor and shame that they endure their new position as tributary.

## House Kratyss

House Kratyss, House of the Smoking Stone, is one of several nomadic tribes that travel the Burnished Plains. They take their name from the Giant Obelisk that marks a completed journey on their path through the plains. The Smoking Stone is cool to the touch and begins the day solid to the touch. It sublimates as the sun beats down on it, continually shedding its mass in inky wisps until only a smooth platform is left. The area surrounding the obelisk is comfortably cool no matter how hot the surrounding area gets. House Kratyss is known for procuring rare and dangerous cyphers along their travels. Though it is forbidden, it is an open secret that House Kratyss heavily curates their tributes to the ruling cities, keeping the most dangerous cyphers for themselves.

## House Deseia

House Deseia, House of the Weeping Tower, is a small settlement in the Burnished Plains that has made a fortress out of the Weeping Tower, a towering bronze monolith with precisely carved holes along its sides that continually spout water. Structures have been built atop and hanging from the tower itself, using the tower's height as a defense against raiders. The House of the Weeping tower serves the other tribes as a permanent settlement where merchants and other professionals can trade in peace and replenish their supplies. Though the faction is small, they have threatened to destroy the tower if their control of the tower was ever threatened.

## House Haolus

House Haolus, House of the Screaming Ones, is one of several nomadic tribes that travel the Burnished Plains. They are a vicious tribe, known for attacking travelers and neighbors without warning. They are called the Screaming Ones both because of the war-cries they are known by and because of their coming-of-age rituals. Young Screaming Ones wander the plains in groups, seeking out ancient ruins and the numenera they hold. These adventures are deadly, and not all will return. Those who do have their retrieved numenera grafted unto their bodies, a painful and often deadly process. Throughout the process, more initiates will die. The older members of the tribe will scream throughout the process, both in solidarity with the agonized initiates, and as a mourning of the lives lost in pursuit of apotheosis.

Warriors of House Haolus are renowned for their prowess and courage, and are often sought as mercenaries and hunters by other factions.

## Elyss

Elyss, Land of Burning Water, is an area of land dotted with Prismatic Hot Springs, shimmering pools of water that erupt from beneath the earth. The hot springs are tended by a collection of families, and the title of ruling family changes often as leaders rise and fall. The temperatures and depths of the hot springs vary, ranging from pleasantly hot to skin-melting, knee deep to abyssal. Without exception, each shimmering pool acts as a portal for anything that reaches its depths, and those who both survive the journey and return are hailed as heroes.

## Shabara

Shabara, Land of Broken Sky, is a dark world south of the Burnished Plains where the sun loses its power. Giant Floating Plates made of the same material as the Emperor's Palace hang high in the sky, shrouding the land in gloom as they slowly shift and turn. The plates are broken and fragmented, and areas between these shapes where light filters through are somehow brighter and hotter than the rest of the World and burn those who cross. Citizens of the Land of Broken Sky do not recognize the ruling cities and pay no tribute, and incursions into the Land of Broken Sky have proved devastatingly unsuccessful. Nevertheless, its citizens are content to trade and socialize with members of the tributaries.
