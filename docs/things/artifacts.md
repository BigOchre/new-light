List of artifacts the group has come across on their adventures:

### Tezico's Multi-Material Container - Level 4

<em>A small orb made of stone covered in numerous bulbous sacks that pulse like a toad's throat. Several of the sacks have either burst or solidified. Four of them remain intact. </em>

With a command word, a sack can be opened and contain up to 6 cubic meters of a liquid or gaseous material. No other sack can contain the same material (or else). Each use has 1d20 chance of permanent failure.
