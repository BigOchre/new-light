# The Sea Ringed World

There was never nothing. Before you, or me, or time itself, existed Darkness. And at the center of it, amid the swirling gloom, existed Light. In an act of love, Light created the stars from her body. She scattered them around herself as a bulwark against the encroaching Darkness, and in the space between herself and the firmament of stars, the Mute God gave birth to our world, a barren world circling what was left of her. This would have been the end of our story, but she had more to give. Using the last of her wisdom, she seeded our world with all that we require and gifted us with a paradisiacal garden.

Our world is a gift given through sacrifice. Our creator the Mute God gave her body to create the stars that protect us from the cold and dark. She gave her mind to give us life and grant us this promised land. Her light lives in us, along with her capacity for sacrifice.
As the stars flicker and die, giving their lives to protect us from the endless onslaught of the hungering dark, We offer ourselves to the Mute God. The lore differs on what our creator does with our sacrifice. Some say our souls return to the creator god, who in turn uses her returned strength to reignite the stars. Others say our souls themselves ascend and we become warriors in the endless struggle. Regardless, it is our duty. Our life and light is borrowed, and we are honored to return them to our creator.

## 0 | The Council of the Obsidian Table

Each year the sky grows darker as the stars in the sky flicker and fade into darkness. The Ritual of New Light was completed less than a century ago and our calendars say the appointed time for the ritual is more than a decade away. The Eater of Light, the only remaining keeper of the Temple of Light, warned that a new ritual would be required within a year's time. The stars are disappearing faster than the calendar makers could have predicted, and the rituals are losing their potency.

Now, less than half a year before the newly scheduled ritual, Chosen are being captured from each settlement as offerings to the Mute God. The Eater of Light has gone missing, and now a council has been called to gather the city-states and major guilds together. Will we seek the missing Eater of Light? Will we appoint a new one? Will we continue with the appointed number of chosen or will we offer more sacrifices in an attempt to appease our Creator and defend against the Darkness? Or will new paths of action be decided?

## 1 | A Plot Thwarted and a Destination Set

The group, at the behest of one of the royal guard, infiltrated a Non controlled science warehouse and retrieved a singularity creation device that a rogue group wanted to use to assassinate the gathered world leaders. After having met with the numenerist Tezico, the group decided to visit the Valley of the Last Gasp. There are rumors that there are hidden treasures untouched for ages that might protect against the horrors of the darkening night.
