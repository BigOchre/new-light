# The Sea Ringed World

There was never nothing. Before you, or me, or time itself, existed Darkness. And at the center of it, amid the swirling gloom, existed Light. In an act of love, Light created the stars from her body. She scattered them around herself as a bulwark against the encroaching Darkness, and in the space between herself and the firmament of stars, the Mute God gave birth to our world, a barren world circling what was left of her. This would have been the end of our story, but she had more to give. Using the last of her wisdom, she seeded our world with all that we require and gifted us with a paradisiacal garden.

Our world is a gift given through sacrifice. Our creator the Mute God gave her body to create the stars that protect us from the cold and dark. She gave her mind to give us life and grant us this promised land. Her light lives in us, along with her capacity for sacrifice.
As the stars flicker and die, giving their lives to protect us from the endless onslaught of the hungering dark, We offer ourselves to the Mute God. The lore differs on what our creator does with our sacrifice. Some say our souls return to the creator god, who in turn uses her returned strength to reignite the stars. Others say our souls themselves ascend and we become warriors in the endless struggle. Regardless, it is our duty. Our life and light is borrowed, and we are honored to return them to our creator.

## 0 | The Council of the Obsidian Table

Each year the sky grows darker as the stars in the sky flicker and fade into darkness. The Ritual of New Light was completed less than a century ago and our calendars say the appointed time for the ritual is more than a decade away. The Eater of Light, the only remaining keeper of the Temple of Light, warned that a new ritual would be required within a year's time. The stars are disappearing faster than the calendar makers could have predicted, and the rituals are losing their potency.

Now, less than half a year before the newly scheduled ritual, Chosen are being captured from each settlement as offerings to the Mute God. The Eater of Light has gone missing, and now a council has been called to gather the city-states and major guilds together. Will we seek the missing Eater of Light? Will we appoint a new one? Will we continue with the appointed number of chosen or will we offer more sacrifices in an attempt to appease our Creator and defend against the Darkness? Or will new paths of action be decided?

## 1 | A Plot Thwarted and a Destination Set

The group, at the behest of one of the royal guard, infiltrated a Non controlled science warehouse and retrieved a singularity creation device that a rogue group wanted to use to assassinate the gathered world leaders. After having met with the numenerist Tezico, the group decided to visit the Valley of the Last Gasp. There are rumors that there are hidden treasures untouched for ages that might protect against the horrors of the darkening night.

## 2 | A Day at the Festival

The group splits up to prepare for the journey ahead, oblivious to both the religious and festive ceremonies around them. Baolo joins a pit fight and wins handily, permanently injuring his opponent, Tavrolosh, and almost harming Daliah and Elyssa. They win money. Daliah and Ezra both research their destination, and Corvus avoids speaking with his father until he can't any longer. They buy a long boat. In the dead of night, Daliah is warned by an agent of Nahim that catastrophe is coming and that the group should leave Sochitlan before nightfall or they might not be able to leave at all. 

## 3 | Departure, then Dendritic Networks 

Hearing of the coming catastrophe, Ezra leaves his teleporter with his Dottice, his wife, in case she needs a way out. Corvus and Elyssa both share a moment with Rask, and Baolo avoids his father. The group leaves peacefully in the night to watch an enourmous creature made of shadow and tentacles spontaneously appear atop the obsidian pyramid and wreak havoc on the city below. Ezra takes a moment of silence while the others argue about their food situation and what boats are. 

They eventually reach the village of Emul, run by Talitha and her guards, Nael & Dael (not related). Talitha offers have of their provisions if the group manages to free them from the clutches of an energy-sucking mold that's taken hold of their nearby stores. Daliah stays behind to protect the village, and is betrayed by Talitha to a group of slave merchants. Slavery is a complicated thing in the sea-ringed world, but *selling* slaves is always illegal. Daliah turns the tables, and Talitha is taken instead.

Meanwhile, the group explores an ancient temple full of strange machines that the creature is feeding off. After destroying the power source fueling the machines, the group decides to attack the weakened creature instead of waiting for it to leave on its own. They free the temple from the creature's control and return the control of the town's store of bread-spiders and their eggs, but not before Ezra manages to restore one of the machines to working order long enough for them to receive corrupted messages from the intellegences inhabiting the machine:

`The Awareness computes. With [#ERR] hands you must answer. Verdance computes.`

`The Darkness constant lingers. You are a [#ERR] race with aspects of Verdance.` 

`Why does the Darkness linger in you?`

`They are a [#ERR] race. We are Darkness, but they are Aware.`
